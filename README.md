## About the Project

This application is an interactive educational tool designed to demystify **Deep Learning** for audio. Instead of just giving you a prediction (e.g., "This sound is a Dog barking"), it visualizes the **intermediate layers** of the neural network.

Users can upload a `.wav` file, and the system renders:
1.  **Input Spectrogram**: The raw visual representation of the audio frequencies.
2.  **Layer Activations**: Heatmaps showing what specific features the CNN filters are detecting (edges, textures, patterns).
3.  **Real-time Waveform**: An interactive audio player.
4.  **Prediction Confidence**: A breakdown of the top 3 predicted classes.

## Why I Built This

As a Computer Science student and AI enthusiast, I realized that while many people use Neural Networks, few understand what happens *inside* the "black box."

I built this project to:
* **Bridge the gap** between theoretical Deep Learning concepts and practical visualization.
* Demonstrate how **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**—typically used for images—can be applied to audio via spectrograms.
* Experiment with **Serverless GPU Inference** using Modal to serve heavy AI models cheaply and efficiently.

## System Architecture

### The Backend & AI Model
The core of the analysis happens on a **serverless GPU container** hosted on Modal.
1.  **Input**: The frontend converts the `.wav` file to a Base64 string and sends it to the Modal API endpoint.
2.  **Preprocessing**: The Python backend converts the raw audio into a **Mel Spectrogram**.
3.  **Inference**:
    * The spectrogram is passed through 4 Convolutional layers.
    * **Hooks** capture the output of each layer (activation maps) before the final classification.
4.  **Output**: The API returns the top predictions AND the raw activation data for visualization.

### The Frontend
* **Real-time Rendering**: We don't use pre-made images. The frontend receives raw numerical arrays (tensors) from the API and renders them pixel-by-pixel onto HTML5 Canvases using a custom "Viridis" color map.
* **State Management**: React state handles the file upload lifecycle (Uploading -> Processing -> Rendering).

### Authentication
* **Clerk Auth**: Authentication is handled via Clerk.
* **Middleware**: A `middleware.ts` file protects the app. The Homepage is public, but the API interactions and History Sidebar require a signed-in session.
* **Database Sync**: When a user uploads a file, we store the result in the SQLite database linked to their Clerk User ID.

## AI Model Performance

The model was trained on the **ESC-50 Dataset** (Environmental Sound Classification) for 100 Epochs. The training logs show a steady convergence with a final validation accuracy of **~83.25%**.

* **Dataset**: 2,000 labeled audio clips (50 classes).
* **Architecture**: Custom CNN with Max Pooling and ReLU activations.
* **Optimizer**: AdamW with OneCycleLR scheduler.
